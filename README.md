- 👋 Hi, I’m @robaase69
- 👀 I’m interested in alternative lifestyles and living. Im a full time RV'er with a passion for tiny homes and mobile sustainability. Im still very much a newbie. Ive been doing individual studies in CSS, HTML and JavaScript, with some exposure to PHP and MySql. The goal in mind is to gain a marketable skillset in front end development and JavaScript in particular as a means to making income while pursuing other interests. Im currently interested in freelance work arrangements that may involve overly simplistic repetitive tasks that will keep me coding and developing complexity from there.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about connecting to and interacting with various API's. Connecting to and writing to reading from database structures. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I might be able to add value too and make income from ...
